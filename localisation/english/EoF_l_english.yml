We shall take the donations thay have so generously provided, add some at the top, repackage it, and give back in a form of government tenders for industrial development. Since they have already proven their dedication, we do not need to provide unnesesary oversight."

EoF.ole.5.d:0 "A lavish state dinner has been ended in an extremely rude manner by a runner bursting in and announcing that the Changelings have ACTUALLY declared war on them. Surprisingly, instead of panic, the room was just filled with disbelef and stupification. The only sound was of foreign minister murmuring 'They can just do that?'. Needless to say, the hastily written unconditional capitulation message written on top of unused press release was delivered along with kings letter pleading Crysallis personally to spare his life."

They are not well liked by average olenian. We have a long line of changeling replacements for them (those guys are just as corrupt, but in a way that benefits us). Those 3 factors ensure that the rich of Olenia have absolutely no leverage over us, they are simply yet to get it. With enough examples provided, the less thick headed among them will realise the only way they have to save their hide and their wealth. The more thick skulled are, of course, on the top of the examples list already. Make sure to bring armor piercing bullets!"

EoF_orb_of_chital_desc:0 "Born in Kiria, Orb of Chital is widely known for two things: that he never gives up even against the worst odds, and that his analogies and wild jumps in logic never make sense.\n\nBest exemplified by his favorite phrase 'can win', Orb of Chital's philosophy is centered around the belief that maximum effort should be exerted even in hopeless scenarios, because a bad outcome is still preferable to a disastrous one. While not a religious man, his faith in himself and those around him, particularly in the Long March, is legendary. \n\nAccording to Orb of Chital, his genius will only be revealed to the rest of the world once mindreading magic is discovered. Until then, his thoughts remain trapped inside his mind, unable to be vocalized in a way his peers may comprehend. Perhaps in the future this hypothesis will be put to the test. In the meantime, UPA high command have opted to simply take his words at face value so as to avoid any strange metaphors. \n\nRumors say that he hates ponies so much that he replaces every painting of them with weird hairless bipedal creatures."
