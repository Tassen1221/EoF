However, while our troops will be spared the harshest effects, the toxicity and proximity will still likely cause adverse effects within our army.\n\nFor us to deploy such a weapon, we need your explicit signed permission, my princess."

Those 3 factors ensure that the rich of Olenia have absolutely no leverage over us, they are simply yet to get it. With enough examples provided, the less thick headed among them will realise the only way they have to save their hide and their wealth.

While not a religious man, his faith in himself and those around him, particularly in the Long March, is legendary. \n\nAccording to Orb of Chital, his genius will only be revealed to the rest of the world once mindreading magic is discovered. Until then, his thoughts remain trapped inside his mind, unable to be vocalized in a way his peers may comprehend. Perhaps in the future this hypothesis will be put to the test. In the meantime, UPA high command have opted to simply take his words at face value so as to avoid any strange metaphors. \n\nRumors say that he hates ponies so much that he replaces every painting of them with weird hairless bipedal creatures."
