While not a religious man, his faith in himself and those around him, particularly in the Long March, is legendary. \n\nAccording to Orb of Chital, his genius will only be revealed to the rest of the world once mindreading magic is discovered. Until then, his thoughts remain trapped inside his mind, unable to be vocalized in a way his peers may comprehend. Perhaps in the future this hypothesis will be put to the test. In the meantime, UPA high command have opted to simply take his words at face value so as to avoid any strange metaphors. \n\nRumors say that he hates ponies so much that he replaces every painting of them with weird hairless bipedal creatures."
