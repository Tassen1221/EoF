  EoF_JER.9.desc:0 "Dignitaries from the Changeling Lands, Griffonian Republic, Griffonian Empire, and the Aquileian Republic have gathered in Cloudbury to discuss the future of the Griffonian continent. Observers from Olenia, the Polar Bears, Nova Griffonia, and Kiria watch with keen interest, knowing that the decisions made here could reshape the continent's balance of power.\n\nAs the delegates take their seats in the grand hall, tension lingers in the air—many of these nations have long been adversaries, separated by history, ideology, and ambition. Yet today, they face a shared reality: the growing might of Equestria, Wingbardy, Hippogriffia, and the River Coalition.\n\nBefore the negotiations can begin, a representative of the Griffonian Republic rises from his seat. His voice carries through the chamber with quiet determination.\n\nFor centuries, Griffonia has been a continent of division. We have fought, schemed, and bled against one another while others beyond our shores have grown united, prosperous, and strong. And now, they look upon us—not with fear, nor even with respect, but with quiet certainty that we will remain as we have always been: fractured, weak, incapable of standing together.\n\nThey expect us to cling to old grudges and rivalries, to squabble over past glories while they decide the future of the world. They do not see us as a threat. They do not see us as their equals.\n\nThe only question before us now is whether they are right."
