EoF.4.t:0 "Stalliongrad Proposes Deal to Join the UPA"
EoF.4.desc:0 "Stalliongrad has offered us a deal to secure their entry into the UPA. If we return their claimed border territory and give them access to several strategic islands, they would be willing to join our alliance. While the current situation behooves us to accept their proposal, perhaps we should send a counteroffer that does not require us transfer as much territory."
EoF.4.a:0 "Their requests are reasonable."
EoF.4.b:0"A compromise is nessecary."

EoF.5.t:0 "Request Nova Griffonian Assistance"
EoF.5.desc:0 "While our army is more than capable of handing the pathetic Penguins alone, the approach to Amundsen is devoid of infrastructure as well as bordered by both mountains and sea. By asking the Nova Griffonians to join us in this endeavour we will soldify our friendship and speed up our conquest of Pingland."
EoF.5.a:0 "Send the request."

EoF.6.t:0 "First Wesslandia Award"
EoF.6.desc:0 "The Polar Bears have requested we arbitrate a transfer of territorial ownership within the former Griffon Frontier. Bjornling argues that these historical lands were wrongfully colonized during the height of the Griffonian Empire but have now been left in a sordid state by the incompetent Nova Griffonian government. Thusly, he claims, that under Polar Bear management the full potential of these lands may be utilized for the greater good of the Changeling Hegemony."
EoF.6.a:0 "He has a point, but Nova Griffonia is still an ally."
EoF.6.b:0 "Bjornling is right, they are weak."

Thusly, he claims, that under Polar Bear management the full potential of these lands may be utilized for the greater good of the Changeling Hegemony. Additionally, under advice from Griffonian Republic diplomats, Bjornling has also requested that some territory be given to Nova Griffonia."

EoF.18.t:0 "Compromise Reached"
EoF.18.desc:0 "While Equestria has agreed to return our rightful border territories, they are unwilling to give up control of several strategic islands. As such, we are not obligated to immediately join the UPA and will instead transition into the alliance more slowly."
EoF.18.a:0 "Tough negotiations."

EoF_great_war.1.t:0 "Sunset's Counteroffensive"
EoF_great_war.1.desc:0 "In our darkest hour, an unexpected ally has appeared to help us. Despite being gone for several years, Sunset Shimmer has recently returned to help Equestria defend against the Changeling attack, and she did not return alone. Over the past week, hundreds of thousands of volunteer soldiers from alternate dimensions have arrived along with heavy equipment and integrated themselves within our armed forces."
EoF_great_war.1.a:0 "This war now spans more than one world..."

EoF_great_war.2.t:0 "The Question of Winter"
EoF_great_war.2.desc:0 "The premier question facing our high command at this moment is whether to attack immediately or wait until winter is over to launch our offensive. While every day wasted allows Equestria to mobilize more material, the harsh conditions of winter risk blunting our operation before it even begins."
EoF_great_war.2.a:0 "Our actions in the next few months will decide the war, attack immediately."
EoF_great_war.2.b:0 "The Equestrian response will be slow, a summer attack will break them."

EoF_great_war.3.b:0 "Maintain steady production."
EoF_great_war.3.c:0 "Prepare to increase long-term production."

EoF_great_war.4.t:0 "Our New War Plan"
EoF_great_war.4.desc:0 "So like we gotta come up with a plan to stop the Changelings right? Pick the option you think is the most meta, probably the second or third one. First one's not gonna be good until I rework the island campaign mechanics, though you do get a couple more planes I guess. Man, I need someone to write my events for me."
EoF_great_war.4.a:0 "The floatie and the flyie things, I like'em."
EoF_great_war.4.b:0 "Ackchyually, the increased mils and factory output is better."

EoF_great_war.5.t:0 "Reform from the Roots"
EoF_great_war.5.desc:0 "Despite attempts to improve our army command and doctrine pre-war, combat with the Changelings has made it clear that temporary and unplanned solutions will not do. The Equestrian military needs to be reformed from its very roots with clear and specific guiding principles. In order to effect this change, we must decide on a chief architect who will lead us in this task."
EoF_great_war.5.a:0 "Luna."
EoF_great_war.5.b:0 "Blueblood."

EoF_great_war.6.t:0 "Army Incompetence"
EoF_great_war.6.desc:0 "In the face of the Changeling offensive, our troops are proving themselves unable to handle sustained combat. Divisonal commanders complain of incompetent officers and poor training, while reports reach high command daily of generals ordering unplanned retreats and failing to communicate. If this does not change quickly, all of our previous effects to modernize and prepare our army will have been for naught."
EoF_great_war.6.a:0 "We must convene a meeting immediately."

EoF_great_war.8.desc:0 "My dear, soviet comrades. I bring grave news. Equestria is at war, nay, Equus itself is on fire. If we are to succeed here and defeat our sole nemesis, this dark thing, we must try hard. Some might have heard the Changelings deny or reject my ability to turn the tide. To that I say only this, nah I'm a pro."
EoF_great_war.8.a:0 "Hearts of Iron."

EoF_great_war.9.t:0 "Contingency Plans"
EoF_great_war.9.desc:0 "My princess, our current military forces have proven unable to fully contain the Changeling offensive. As such, it is now imperative to begin the development of contingencies to halt the enemy's advance if conventional means fail. The war council has reluctantly suggested the potential use of chemical weapons as a last resort. This decision weighs heavily on my conscience, knowing the devastating consequences it could bring, but the survival of Equestria may depend on our ability to enact such drastic measures.\n\nWith your permission, our scientists may begin the work of developing and stockpiling the prerequisite amount of chemical agent nessecary to grant us this capibility."
EoF_great_war.9.a:0 "Take the utmost caution, but proceed."

EoF_great_war.10.t:0 "Operation Vegetarian"
EoF_great_war.10.desc:0 "Our scientists have recently completed the refinement of large quantities of the insecticide Ant-Thrax. Although the ecological and ethical implications are massive, the fate of our populace under Changeling occupation is worse. Enemy aerial power prevents the effective deployment of these chemical weapons by air; therefore, the only possible delivery method will be via high-power artillery. However, while our troops will be spared the harshest effects, the toxicity and proximity will still likely cause adverse effects within our army.\n\nFor us to deploy such a weapon, we need your explicit signed permission, my princess."
EoF_great_war.10.a:0 "Ruthlessness is mercy upon ourselves."

EoF_great_war.11.t:0 "Sunset Armour Selection"
EoF_great_war.11.desc:0 "Marshal Sunset has presented us with several options on available armour support options from our otherworldly benefactors. It should be known that the total expense of the pledged support will not change depending on our selected option; therefore, the request for heavier vehicles will in turn result in a lesser total vehicle count."

Even though this has basically no political implications whatsoever, everyone around the world is tense for some reason. Observers do comment; however, that this is incredibly convenient if a war were to break out between the countries of Northern Equus and Southern Equus to prevent either of the bordering countries from being rolled over instantly."

EoF.news.2.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader] Recent Abyssinian war camps have been spotted close to the border around El Alamane. Although no aggressive actions have been taken yet, the movement of additional troops and stockpiling of supplies in the region lends credence to theories of a possible attack in the future. Equally importantly, it is as of yet unknown whether the Abyssianian government is undertaking this operation alone, or is doing so under the orders of the Changelings. Though with their head of government currently missing, it seems likely that the Abyssinian military is recieving orders from elsewhere."
